Yet another type of variables
1)local
2)instance variable
3)static variables

Local Variable:
Any variable that is declared inside a method or a block like while loop, for loop, if condition or
inside the constructor are called local variables.
Properties of local variables...
1) we can't access them outside of the block
for ex:
if(2>1){
int x=10 //This variables will not be accessible outside of the curly brackets of the if condition
}
x=20 CE...Compiler Error
2)As soon as we are done with the method these local variables are destroyed and memory(RAM) is freed and available to be
used by other programs. Which means they are very efficient in managing memories, that's why they are recommended
over instance variables.

Instance Variables: All of variables which are declared outside of the method or blocks or constructor
but inside a class are called instance variables.
Properties of Instance Variable:
1) memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created and
it says in the memory unless we are done with closing bracket.
2) They are highly discouraged because they are not efficient in handling memory(RAM)

Static Variables:
They are declared outside of the method, constructor and blocks of codes with static keyword

Access Modifiers:
Access Modifiers are just keywords (Private public protected) that help use reduce the visibility of our
variables and methods, so that no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data.
Private:
If we use Private access modifier with our variable or method we can only access that variable from the same class
We use it to protect critical information, that we do not want to expose
class Account{
private int balance;

void depositMoney(){
if(properChannel, int money){

balance=balance+money
}
}
}

class hacker{
balance=100000;//CE Compiler Error
}

Default:
This is not a keyword it is a behaviour which is assigned to the methods of properties automatically if we are
not assigning any access modifier.

class{
String Car;

}

package 2
class family{
car="I am your little brother, i am using your car today, forgive i destroy it"
}

If we do not specify any modifiers behaviour will be assigned to our variables and methods and they will only
be available within the same package

public:
if we declare our methods or instance variables we can access them from anywhere any package any class

package1
class{
public String car;

}

package2
class family{
car="i am your just a random guy i am using your car today forgive i destroy it"
}
