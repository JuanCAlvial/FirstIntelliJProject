Methods in Java-block of code that performs certain action.
Built-in methods such as string.length-> returns number of characters in a string
Methods:
with parameters
without parameters
Parameters Vs Arguments?
Parameters- is the data type, Arguments- is the actual value

Create a method to return the result of adding numbers...

public double addNumbers(double num1, double num2){
return num1+num2;
}
Must have parts in methods
1) return type (we can return any type primitive or non primitive, void)
2.	Name of the Method
3.	Parameters/No parameters
Benefits of methods
1.	Reduce code duplication
2.	Cleaner and manageable code
3.	Save memory
4.	Increases Readability
Variables
local variables
any variable that is declared inside a method or a block or a constructor is
called a local variables.
