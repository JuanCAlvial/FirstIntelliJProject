Final Keyword:
Final is a keyword in jave that can be used with class field and methods. if we have declared a class as final then
no other class can inherit our class.

final public class Democlass{

int number;
democlass(int number){
this.number=number
}
void printNumber(){
sout number
}
}

public class Childclass extends DemoClass{//cannot inherit from A final class

}

Benefits of final class:
1) Privacy
2) A<-B<-C<-D.... if we have a very long chain of classes which have a inheritance relationship and if we want to
restrict this chain we can use the final keyword...WHY?...bc we may waste a lot of memory if we do not use these
classes properly
