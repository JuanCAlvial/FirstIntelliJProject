StringBuffer and StringBuilder

What they have in common?
1)Classes used to make modifications to Strings of characters
2)Can be modified without leaving behind unused objects
ex:
//Immutable-State cannot change
String s = "hello";
s+=" world";//new object created
System.out.println(s);
--------------------------------------
//Mutable-State can change
StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer("hello");
sb.append( "world");//new object not created
System.out.println(sb);

Key Differences?
StringBuffer
1)Synchronized(thread-safe)
2)Synchronized methods to control access so that only one thread can access a StringBuffer objects
synchronized code at a time
3)Slower than StringBuilder(Take more time)

StringBuilder
1)Non-synchronized(not thread safe)
2)Does not contain synchronized methods
3)Faster that StringBuffer

Thread safe-- Code has ability to guarantee safe execution by multiple threads at the same time...
