Super Keyword:
1)Super refers to the immediate parent class.
2)It is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
3)Using the super we can access immediate parent class constructor/ fields and methods.
4)We use super with small brackets to invoke parent class constructor
5) when we do not provide super keyword with small bracket Compiler will provide us one

Overloading:
overloading is a mechanism in java that help us write methods/constructor
with same name but with different parameters or different number of parameters
or with different sequence of parameters
