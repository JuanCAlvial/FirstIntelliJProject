Main OOPS concept in java:
1) Inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation

1) Inheritance:
Is a mechanism to re3fer functions and fields from parent class to subclasses. It is a process where on class requires
the properties and methods of another class.

2)Polymorphism:
The ability of the object to take many forms being able to do multiple functions using same reference variable but with
different objects. Process when object can perform actions in different way. There are two types of Polymorphism
runtime/dynamic late binding and compile time early binding or static.
We can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading. we can achieve dynamic or runtime binding using
method overriding.

3)Abstraction
abstraction is a process of showing the functionality to the user but hiding the processes or implementation behind it
To implement Abstraction we use abstract

If we have declared a class as abstract we can not create objects of that class

Key Points:
Abstract class:
1) can have Abstract and non abstract method
2) can have constructor
3) can have instance and static members
4) can have static and final methods and fields
5)abstract methods can't have static  modifier and can not be private and
we can not make them final

We can not create objects of Abstract class.
