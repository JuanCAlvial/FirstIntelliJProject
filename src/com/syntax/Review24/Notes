Class:
classes are blueprints/Templates/States/blovk of code....Thats helps us model a real life object such as, car/ bikes/
computers/etc.
Ex:
We can have a Car class which can have properties and behaviours that can be used to build a specific model of car like
Toyota, Subaru, Mazda...

class NameOfClass{
String model;
String make;
String color;
int year;

//behaviours of car
void drive(){
sout""
}
void switchGear(){
sout""
}
void applyBrakes(){
sout""
}
void drift(){

}

}
In a class we can have fields/methods/constructors/initializer blocks

what is the difference between a class and object?
class is a blueprint
obj is an instance of a class
