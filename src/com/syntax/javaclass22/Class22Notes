Super Keyword:
Super is a keyword in java that we can use to access immediate parent class members like fields,
methods and constructors.

MethodOverLoading:
1)Is a way of utilizing methods with different parameters but same name.
2)Allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their arguments are differet.
In java we can distinguish between methods by method signature method signature is a combination of method name type of
parameters that we are passing as an argument and the sequence of the parameters.

we can create methods with same name if the parameters to our methods have the below properties...
1)method should have different number of parameters

print(){}
print(String name){}
print(String name, String address){
}
print(String naame, String address, String phoneNumbers){
}
2)We can overload methods we provide different types of parameters.
print(){}
print(String name){}
print(int num1){
}
print(double num1){
}
3)We can also overload our methods if we change the sequence of the parameters
print(String name, int num, char c){}
print(char c, String name, int num){}
print(int num, char c, String name){
}
print(double num1){
}

Note:
By changing the return type or the access modifiers we can not overload
methods in java
