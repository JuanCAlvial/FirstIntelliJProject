Inheritance:
Inheritance is the mechanism in java through which we can use the fields and methods from one class to other class
without re-writing a single line of code/ repeating the code from class from which we are inheriting

Benefits of using Inheritance:
1)Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution.
2) It helps reduce duplicate codes
3) saves time
4) reusing the same code again

Disadvantages:
Classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class
ex:
Class Parent{

int Money;
void print(){
sout "Money ="+Money
}
}

class Child extends Parent{
main{}
Child child = new Child()
child.print();
}
}

we can access our static fields and methods using class names and using objects of the class but using Class name is
preferable because static methods and fields belong to class not to object

SuperKeyword:
As we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can use super keyword to access the
fields and methods from immediate parent class.
It is used in subclasses to access members superclass members
in inheritance when we create an object of a class all of the default constructors from p
